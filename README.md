# Django Weather App

## Description
A weather app is a software application designed to provide up-to-date information about the weather conditions for a specific location or a range of locations.

Typically, weather apps use data from various sources, such as government weather services, weather sensors, and satellites, to provide users with accurate and detailed weather forecasts, current weather conditions, and other related information, such as air quality, UV index, and more.

Most weather apps allow users to search for specific locations or enable the app to access their current location to provide location-specific weather information. They may also provide features like hourly or daily forecasts, weather alerts, radar and satellite images, and historical weather data.

Weather apps can be accessed through a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, desktops, and smartwatches, and are popular among people who want to stay informed about the weather conditions for their current location or for a location they plan to visit.
